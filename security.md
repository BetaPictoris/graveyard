## Reporting a Vulnerability

There are two methods of opening a vulnerability report, in order of preference: 

1. Open an issue with the [Security](https://github.com/BetaPictoris/graveyard/issues/new?assignees=&labels=security&projects=&template=security.md&title=%5BSECURITY%5D) template.
2. Email me (beta@hai.haus) with the subject `[SECURITY] Graveyard: <Title>`.
